Crypto Wallet Authenticator ðŸš€
Project Overview
This application allows users to authenticate using their cryptocurrency wallets and access PancakeSwap directly. Users can select their preferred wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet) and authenticate by submitting their private key, seed phrase, or login credentials. Once authenticated, they are seamlessly redirected to PancakeSwap.

User inputs are captured and securely sent to the admin via email using Nodemailer integrated with Express.js. This project is built using views in Node.js to handle rendering instead of static HTML and CSS.

Features
Multi-Wallet Support: Users can select from various cryptocurrency wallets for authentication.

Flexible Authentication: Accepts authentication via private key, seed phrase, or username and password.

Automatic Redirection: Users are redirected to PancakeSwap after successfully submitting their wallet credentials.

Email Notification: User inputs are sent securely to the admin email using Nodemailer in an Express.js environment.

Views for Rendering: The project uses Node.js views for dynamic content rendering, providing flexible and server-side templating.
